## Design Process

### Goals and Audience Definition
The first step involved identifying clear user goals, ensuring the design balanced in-depth scholarly resources with easy-to-navigate interfaces suitable for all types of users.

### Wireframing and Prototyping
I developed detailed wireframes and prototypes using Figma, focusing on clear content hierarchy and intuitive navigation:
- **Home Page:** Three-column grid layout for straightforward navigation.
- **About Page:** Single-column design integrating text, images, and multimedia content to convey Shakespeare’s biography effectively.
- **Search Page:** Minimalist layout with a prominent search bar and interactive results dialog for quick exploration.
- **View-All Page:** Table-driven design enhanced with sorting and searching capabilities, simplifying data navigation.

### Visual Design
- **Color Scheme:** Chosen vellum-textured background paired with navy blue (#2C3E50) for headings and navigation, complemented by lighter tones (#F5F5F5) to maintain a readable yet historically resonant aesthetic.
- **Typography:** Selected Adobe Caslon Pro, aligning with the historical theme and literary significance.

### Accessibility Features
Accessibility was prioritized through:
- WCAG-compliant color contrasts.
- ALT text for image accessibility.
- Tab indexing to facilitate keyboard navigation.
- Fully responsive layouts supporting mobiles, tablets, and desktops.

## External APIs and Libraries
- **Gutenberg API:** Real-time fetching of Shakespearean texts and metadata.
