            <p>
                William Shakespeare, often referred to as the Bard of Avon, remains one of the most influential figures in English literature and drama. Born in April 1564 in the small market town of Stratford-upon-Avon, England, Shakespeare's contributions to the literary world have transcended time, leaving an indelible mark on storytelling, theatre, and the English language itself.

            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>
                Shakespeare was baptized on April 26, 1564, suggesting his birth likely occurred a few days earlier, on April 23. He was the third of eight children born to John Shakespeare, a prosperous glove maker and town official, and Mary Arden, the daughter of a well-to-do farmer. The young Shakespeare likely attended the local grammar school in Stratford, where he would have received a robust education in Latin literature, grammar, and classical texts, which later informed much of his writing.

            <h2>Lost Years</h2>
            <p>
                Little is known about Shakespeare's life during his late teens and early twenties, a period often referred to as the "lost years." Speculation abounds as to how he spent this time, with theories ranging from working as a teacher to traveling with theatrical troupes.
